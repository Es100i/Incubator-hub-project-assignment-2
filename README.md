the*Palmoria Group HR Analysis Capstone Projects
*Project Overview*
As part of the Digital SkillUp Africa (DSA) Data Analysis Bootcamp, I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze HR-related data for Palmoria Group, a Nigerian manufacturing company. The project aimed to uncover gender disparities, salary structures, bonus distribution, and compliance issues.
*Tools Used:*
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop
- Power Query Editor
- DAX Measures & Calculated Columns
- Report View with Slicers and Charts

*Key Tasks:*

- Data cleaning and transformation
- Creating KPIs for salary averages, bonus totals, rating distribution, and gender balance
- Building interactive dashboards

*Key Insights:*

- The company has a relatively balanced gender distribution, with 49.2% male and 46.6% female employees.
- Average salaries vary across regions, departments, and gender, with males earning $75,000 and females earning $72,000 on average.
- Only 30.9% of employees earn above the national minimum threshold of $90,000.
- Bonus payouts differ across departments and regions, with Kaduna leading in regional bonus distribution.
- Performance analysis reveals slight differences across groups, with female employees scoring an average rating of 3.2.

*Recommendations:*
Based on these insights, the company may consider reviewing salary structures, bonus allocations, and performance evaluation processes to ensure fairness and equity.
